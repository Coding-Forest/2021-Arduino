    A GPIO (general-purpose input/output) port handles both incoming and outgoing digital signals. 
    As an input port, it can be used to communicate to the CPU the ON/OFF signals received from switches, 
    or the digital readings received from sensors. 
    As an output port, it can be used to drive outside operations based on CPU instructions and calculation resultsâ€”for example, 
    to drive an LED display based on calculation results, or to output drive signals to a motor.

    The GPIO is referred to as "general purpose" because each pin can be freely set to function as either an input or an output. 
    In early MCUs, each port was either exclusively input or exclusively output. 
    A GPIO is flexible, however. If it has 8 pins, you can set them as best suits your needs: 
    4 input and 4 output, or 7 input and 1 output, or any other combination (Renesas, n.a.).
    
**Application of Shift Registers**
 
1) Allows to control an infinite number of outputs using a limited number of input pins (in your Arduino).
